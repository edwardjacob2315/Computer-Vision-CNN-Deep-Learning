- The Dataset is a Bran Tumor MRI Scan, which there is MRI Scan images that HAVE Tumor on Brain and DOES NOT HAVE a Tumor on Brain
- The objective is to Create a computer vision model to identify which image HAVE Brain Tumor and which image DOES NOT HAVE Brain Tumor using a Convolutional Neural Network.
